# failed_with_exit_code_1

You received and "failed with exit code 1" when you compile. (3 frameworks got error)

Compilation error [solved]:

- Try select: Product -> Clean.
- Then, you try select: Product, then hold alt Key, then "Clean Build Folder..."
- If this doesn't work out, you do Sudo Reboot.

When I opened Xcode again, the project compiled successfully.
